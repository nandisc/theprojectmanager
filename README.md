# The Project Manager
A CLI utility for keeping project's in sync between various project management tools (email, tasks, files).

## Purpose

This utility is intended to make it easier to maintain a "system" around your projects.  In our digital world, nearly every project has different assets like files, notes, tasks, milestones, projections, etc.  If you adopt the Unix philosophy, there are some great tools that manage their respective assets.  However, keeping them synced is difficult, and thus we're driven to all-in-one solutions which are less adaptable to our workflow needs.

The Project Manager helps by keeping the individually powerful tools in sync with one another.  Similar to how you can chain commands together in a Unix system.  The goal is to make it easy to create, archive, and delete projects across any number of tools using a simple system of integrations (plugins) that can handle these modifications in a way that is native (and unique) to each tool.
